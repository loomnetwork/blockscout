BlockScout provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on **all EVM** (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains. This includes the Ethereum main and test networks as well as **Ethereum forks and sidechains**.

## Features

- **Open source development**: The code is community driven and available for anyone to use, explore and improve.

- **Real time transaction tracking**: Transactions are updated in real time - no page refresh required. Infinite scrolling is also enabled.

- **Smart contract interaction**: Users can read and verify Solidity smart contracts and access pre-existing contracts to fast-track development. Support for Vyper, LLL, and Web Assembly contracts is in progress.

- **Token support**: ERC20 and ERC721 tokens are supported. Future releases will support additional token types including ERC223 and ERC1155.

- **User customization**: Users can easily deploy on a network and customize the Bootstrap interface.

-  **Ethereum sidechain networks**: BlockScout supports the Ethereum mainnet, Ethereum testnets, POA network, and forks like Ethereum Classic, xDAI, additional sidechains, and private EVM networks.
