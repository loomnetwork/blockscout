## About BlockScout

BlockScout is an Elixir application that allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, and verify smart contracts on the entire Ethereum network including all forks and sidechains.

Currently available block explorers (i.e. Etherscan and Etherchain) are closed systems which are not independently verifiable.  As Ethereum sidechains continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent tools are needed to analyze and validate transactions.

Information on the latest release and version history is available [on our forum](https://forum.poa.network/c/blockscout/releases)
